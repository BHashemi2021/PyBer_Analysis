# PyBer Analysis
Module 5 Challenge - Pyber, a Ridesharing App

Background
It's your second week as a data analyst at PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. You've just been assigned your first big project: analyze all the rideshare data from January to early June of 2021 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize.
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment of creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
Task:
We have been tasked to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to 
A-	help improve access to ride-sharing services and 
B-	determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
C-	Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
D-	Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
The tasks in detail include:
Using the Pandas groupby() function with the count() and sum() methods on PyBer DataFrame columns to:
1-	get the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. 
2-	calculate the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type. 
3-	add this data to a new DataFrame, and format the columns.

Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
•	The total number of rides for each city type is retrieved. (5 pt)
•	The total number of drivers for each city type is retrieved. (5 pt)
•	The sum of the fares for each city type is retrieved. (5 pt)
•	The average fare per ride for each city type is calculated. (5 pt)
•	The average fare per driver for each city type is calculated. (5 pt)
•	A PyBer summary DataFrame is created. (5 pt)
•	The PyBer summary DataFrame is formatted as shown in the example. (5 pt)

Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type (45 points)
Using your Pandas skills and two new functions, pivot() andresample(), create a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by city type.

Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (20 points)
Use your repository README file to write your analysis of how to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.

The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Deliverable 3 Requirements
Structure, Organization, and Formatting (6 points)
The written analysis has the following structure, organization, and formatting:
There is a title, and there are multiple sections. (2 pt)
Each section has a heading and subheading. (2 pt)
Links to images are working and displayed correctly. (2 pt)
Analysis (14 points)
The written analysis has the following:
Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)
Results:
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
Summary:
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
Once you’re ready to submit, make sure to check your work against the rubric to ensure you are meeting the requirements for this Challenge one final time. It’s easy to overlook items when you’re in the zone!

As a reminder, the deliverables for this Challenge are as follows:

Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type.
Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.
Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md).
Upload the following to your PyBer_Analysis GitHub repository:
The PyBer_Challenge.ipynb file.
The results need to be kept populated in the PyBer_Challenge.ipynb file. Do not clear the output from the PyBer_Challenge.ipynb file before uploading to GitHub.
The “Resources” folder with the city_data.csv and ride_data.csv files.
The “analysis” folder with the PyBer_fare_summary.png.
An updated README.md that has your written analysis.
